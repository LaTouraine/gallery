<h1>PERSONA:</h1>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Basic Information:</h2>
    <p><span class="label">Name:</span> Jennifer Sumner</p>
    <p><span class="label">Technology:</span> iMac 2019 (Intel) - Big Sur OS, iPhone 8</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Attitudes and Behaviors:</h2>
    <p>Jennifer is a full-time doctor who specializes in elderly care. Although her work is physically demanding and very time-consuming, she deeply values having an aesthetically pleasing environment for herself and her family. Art and design play an important role in her beliefs and lifestyle, even though she rarely has time to create or curate her ideal home environment.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Frustrations your persona may be facing:</h2>
    <p>Jennifer is passionate about her work, but often feels frustrated by the lack of personal time it allows. She wishes she had more time for her family and personal interests such as going to gallery exhibits, theater and home decorating, all of which she finds relaxing and fulfilling.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Goals for Using the Website</h2>
    <p>Because Jennifer has so little time to design and decorate her home she has hired an interior designer to create the type of home she's always dreamed of having. Though her home designer will do all the work Jennifer still wants to participate as much as she has time to, in selecting the art work being bought so she will need an easy way to shop for potential pieces of art work online. After hearing about a few artist suggestions from her designer she will be able to link to their websites on her lunch break and glance through the different styles, categories and sizes of paintings available for sale. Just being able to spend 15 to 30 minutes is all that she will need every other day or so to narrow down her choices and communicate that with her designer.</p>
